# Clean Up

## Overview

The Clean Up feature in SMARTD Studio allows you to quickly clear all graph visualizations from your current workspace. This is useful when you want to start a new analysis or when your workspace becomes cluttered with multiple queries and visualizations.

## Using the Clean Up Feature

### Accessing Clean Up

The Clean Up button is located in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. It appears as a trash bin icon.

### Performing a Clean Up

1. Click the Clean Up button in the toolbar
2. All current graph visualizations will be removed from the workspace
3. Your query history will remain intact
4. Database connections will not be affected

## When to Use Clean Up

### Starting a New Analysis

When you want to begin a fresh analysis, use Clean Up to clear your workspace of previous visualizations.

### Reducing Visual Clutter

If your workspace has become crowded with multiple query results, Clean Up provides a quick way to reset your view.

### Improving Performance

Clearing unnecessary visualizations can help improve application performance, especially when working with large graphs.

## Important Notes

- Clean Up only removes visualizations from your current workspace
- It does not delete any data from the connected database
- Your query history remains accessible
- Any unsaved work or custom layouts will be lost
- Database connections remain active after Clean Up
